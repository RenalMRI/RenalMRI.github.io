Renal MRI

Hi - we were wondering if you would be prepared to free up the name renalmri of your github organisation?

We are coordinating the network renalmri.org (draft webpage on https://renalmri.org/) which has grown out of the EU networking project PARENCHIMA https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA16103/. 

We wanted to create an organisation on github to hold the content for our website and repositories and then noticed it was already taken. If you would be prepared to free it up that would be very much appreciated.

My name is Steven Sourbron (@plaresmedima on github) and I am writing also in the name of the other members of renalmri.org.

Thank you for considering!
